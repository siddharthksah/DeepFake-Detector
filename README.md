# DeepFake-Detector
Finally a simple and WORKING DeepFake image detector

I have also build a webapp based on it. Try it here https://share.streamlit.io/siddharthksah/deepfake-detection-webapp/main.py or http://siddharthsah.com/deepfake

You can also find all the code for this webapp here https://github.com/siddharthksah/DeepFake-Detection-WebApp

I have added the links from where you can easily download the dataset and model weights in the .ipynb notebook main file.

BTW the model.h5 file here is what I saved after training the network for about 3 days on my laptop. You can directly use it for the predictions as well. I have showed how to do it in the end of the code.

This work is based on an awesome notebook I found on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/real-vs-fake-starter-code All credits to the original author.

Have fun!
